# ROADMAP.txt

 These are high-level, planed changes that affect 
 features and caracteristics of TSI at the architectural and design level
  

PRIORITY LEVELS:
1 - MAX
2 - MEDIUM
3 - LOW

1)
	- Improve performance and scalability:
		- Make code 64bit safe. (short term)
		- Reduce time/space complexity of the application. (mid-term, algorithmically bound)
			- possible to reduce memory consuption without tradeofs has of now.
		- Port to MPI to work on multi-computer setups. (mid-long term)

2)
	- rework/restructure code for better modularity 
		better suited to distributed setups.
	- Better/improved accounting. (medium term)
		- Better logger. (short term)
		- Better resource accounting (disk, network, cpu, memory usage data)
		for better suit deployment environments.

3)
	- re-implement MASK, to possibilitate Masking out parts of the reservoir.
		(better simulation granularity, such has improving result on a specific reservoir area)
	
special) - these are long term concepts
	- Reduce time/space complexity of the application. (long-term, algorithmically bound)
		- find ways to paralelize the DSS.
		- algorithmically reduce computational complexity bounds
	- Flexible multi-computer design (speed vs memory size vs interconnect speed tradeoff, etc..)
