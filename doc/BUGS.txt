# BUGS.txt

for each version, all known bugs are listed.
bugs of earlier versions not accounted on more recent version means "bug fixed"

- tsi-4.2-pre
	- running simulations with aplied MASK doesn't work.
	- garbled log file due to simulation threads sharing the same log file.
	- incorrect cpuTime on THREADS > 1, since timer a "process" and not "thread" timer.
	- incorrect cpuTime for long simulations. (possibly counter overflow) 
	(its better to use: $ time ./tsi config.par)
	- compiler optimizations bigger than:
			-O3 -march=pentium2 -ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer
		are unsafe and unreliable.
	- Code is not 64bits clean, only x86 is suported. (amd64 not supported..)
	- GCC4 is know to produce incorrect results, please use gcc3
	- very small memory leak detected...

- tsi-4.0
	- artifacts on final image due to static layering (on layer borders)
	- running simulations with aplied MASK doesn't work.
	- garbled log file due to simulation threads sharing the same log file.
	- incorrect cpuTime on THREADS > 1, since is a "process" and not "thread timer".
	- incorrect cpuTime for long simulations.

- tsi-v3.0
	- running simulations with aplied MASK doesn't work.
	- lack DSS of predictability in result cube, even when invoqued with same SEED.
	- Incorrect time acounting, it counts file dumps on some type of grids, but not others....
